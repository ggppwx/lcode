#  palindrome partitioning ii

[Palindrome Partitioning II](https://leetcode.com/problems/palindrome-partitioning-ii)

Given a string s, partition s such that every substring of the partition is a palindrome. Return the minimum cuts needed for a palindrome partitioning of s.

Example:

```text
Input: "aab"
Output: 1
Explanation: The palindrome partitioning ["aa","b"] could be produced using 1 cut.
```

## Analysis

Time: O\(N^2\), so

## Thoughts

* Using DP to find the palindrome table DP\(i,j\)
* another DP from \(0, length\) 
  * similar to MinCost DP problem. 
  * Get the previous index starting from 0 to current **itself** , then find the minium
  * constructing DP table requires O\(N^2\) so no need to optimize this second pass 
* 居然做了两小时，中间被想到了另一道panlindrom, 但是显然那不是同一道题
  * Longest Palindromic Substring: \( step 1 in this problem \)
  * Longest Palindromic Subsequence: aaba =&gt; aaa =&gt; 3
* This problem usues multiple DP 

## Solution

```python
class Solution:
    def minCut(self, s: str) -> int:
        # DP to find palindrome, DP = is palindrome        
        # DP(i, j ) = DP (i + 1, j -1) if s[i] == s[j]
        length = len(s)
        dp = [[None for _ in range(length)] for _ in range(length)]
        for k in range(length):
            for i in range(length):                
                j = i + k
                if j >= length:
                    break

                if k == 0:
                    # i == j
                    dp[i][j] = True
                    continue
                if k == 1:
                    dp[i][j] = (s[i] == s[j])
                    continue                

                dp[i][j]  = dp[i+1][j-1] and (s[i] == s[j])

        # now we have the palindrome table 
        # it seems this second is still a DP 
        mincut = [10000000] * length
        for current, c in enumerate(s):
            if current == 0:
                mincut[current] = 0
                continue

            # find all minCut before current 
            for before in range(0, current+1):
                if dp[before][current] == True:
                    tmp = 0
                    if before > 0:
                        tmp = mincut[before - 1] + 1
                    mincut[current] = min(mincut[current], tmp)            


        return mincut[length -1]
```
