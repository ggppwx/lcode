# Longest Substring with At Most K Distinct Characters
[Longest Substring with At Most K Distinct Characters](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-substring-with-at-most-k-distinct-characters)

Given a string, find the length of the longest substring T that contains at most k distinct characters.

Example 1:
```
Input: s = "eceba", k = 2
Output: 3
Explanation: T is "ece" which its length is 3.
```
## Analysis
- sliding window checked
- hashmap checked ( to find the distinct)
- 2 pointers r, l checked
  - `lenght = r - l` 
- how to move the left pointer is the key
  - once exceeding the limit, we need to remove one key in map. 
  - remove the left most ?
    - **Not** only the leftmost, also need to **Not appear** later
    - we need to save **latest** index for each key 
  - `l = del_index + 1`

## Thoughts
- sliding window problem can use Hashmap to store index
- That helps us fast moving pointer i/j
## Solution
Better solution:
```python
class Solution:
    def lengthOfLongestSubstringKDistinct(self, s: 'str', k: 'int') -> 'int':
        n = len(s) 
        if k == 0 or n == 0:
            return 0
        
        # sliding window left and right pointers
        left, right = 0, 0
        # hashmap character -> its rightmost position 
        # in the sliding window
        hashmap = defaultdict()

        max_len = 1
        
        while right < n:
            # add new character and move right pointer
            hashmap[s[right]] = right
            right += 1

            # slidewindow contains 3 characters
            if len(hashmap) == k + 1:
                # delete the leftmost character
                del_idx = min(hashmap.values())
                del hashmap[s[del_idx]]
                # move left pointer of the slidewindow
                left = del_idx + 1

            max_len = max(max_len, right - left)

        return max_len
```


```python
class Solution:
    def lengthOfLongestSubstringKDistinct(self, s: str, k: int) -> int:
        if k == 0:
            return 0 
        
        c_map = {}
        i = 0
        j = 0
        final = 0
        result = 0
        while i < len(s):
            c_map[s[i]] = c_map.get(s[i], 0) + 1
            result += 1
            while len(c_map) > k and j <= i:
                # reduce
                c_map[s[j]] -= 1
                if c_map[s[j]] == 0:
                    del c_map[s[j]]
                result -= 1
                j += 1
                
            final = max(final, result)
                
            i += 1    
            
        return final
```
