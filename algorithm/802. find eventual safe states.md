# find eventual safe states

[Find Eventual Safe States](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-eventual-safe-states)

In a directed graph, we start at some node and every turn, walk along a directed edge of the graph. If we reach a node that is terminal \(that is, it has no outgoing directed edges\), we stop.

Now, say our starting node is eventually safe if and only if we must eventually walk to a terminal node. More specifically, there exists a natural number K so that for any choice of where to walk, we must have stopped at a terminal node in less than K steps.

Which nodes are eventually safe? Return them as an array in sorted order.

The directed graph has N nodes with labels 0, 1, ..., N-1, where N is the length of graph. The graph is given in the following form: graph\[i\] is a list of labels j such that \(i, j\) is a directed edge of the graph.

Example:

```text
Input: graph = [[1,2],[2,3],[5],[0],[5],[],[]]
Output: [2,4,5,6]
Here is a diagram of the above graph.
```

Note: graph will have length at most 10000. The number of edges in the graph will not exceed 32000. Each graph\[i\] will be a sorted list of different integers, chosen within the range \[0, graph.length - 1\].

## Thoughts

* the problem becomes check if there's a circle
  * Use **Blank and Gray algorithm**, grey = visited, black = finalized 
* if it visits another gray, it is a cycle. Why ? 
  * because it's a directional graph 
* if it is black, just ignore, unlike gray, black means it reaches the final state. 

## Solution

```python
class Solution:
    """ Notes:    
    Be aware:
    1. the state of node (black or gray), if using 2 states, it could accidentally be black and gray, which is wrong
    2. visit condition: not black AND not gray. otherwise could cause infinite loop

    key to Graph problem is:
    1. find the exit condition
    2. find what should visit next 
    """
    def eventualSafeNodes(self, graph: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:
        color = ['N'] * len(graph)

        def visit_safe(node_id):
            color[node_id] = 'Gray'

            ret = True
            for neighbor in graph[node_id]:
                if color[neighbor] == 'Gray':
                    # a circle
                    return False
                if not color[neighbor] == 'Black':
                    ret = ret and visit_safe(neighbor)

            color[node_id] = 'Black'
            return ret

        result = []
        for node in range(len(graph)):
            color = ['N'] * len(graph)

            if visit_safe(node):
                result.append(node)

        return result
