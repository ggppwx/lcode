# random point in non overlapping rectangles

[Random Point in Non-overlapping Rectangles](https://leetcode.com/problems/random-point-in-non-overlapping-rectangles)

Given a list of non-overlapping axis-aligned rectangles rects, write a function pick which randomly and uniformily picks an integer point in the space covered by the rectangles.

Note: An integer point is a point that has integer coordinates. A point on the perimeter of a rectangle is included in the space covered by the rectangles. ith rectangle = rects\[i\] = \[x1,y1,x2,y2\], where \[x1, y1\] are the integer coordinates of the bottom-left corner, and \[x2, y2\] are the integer coordinates of the top-right corner. length and width of each rectangle does not exceed 2000. 1 &lt;= rects.length &lt;= 100 pick return a point as an array of integer coordinates \[p\_x, p\_y\] pick is called at most 10000 times.

Example 1:

```text
Input: 
["Solution","pick","pick","pick"]
[[[[1,1,5,5]]],[],[],[]]
Output: 
[null,[4,1],[4,1],[3,3]]
```

Example 2:

```text
Input: 
["Solution","pick","pick","pick","pick","pick"]
[[[[-2,-2,-1,-1],[1,0,3,0]]],[],[],[],[],[]]
Output: 
[null,[-1,-2],[2,0],[-2,-1],[3,0],[-2,-2]]
```

## Thoughts

* Similar approach as the weighted random number
  * the weight is the area of the rectangle. so it's `right - left + 1`
* binary serach to find the rectangle first, then in the rectangle, randomly pick a point.     

## Solution

```python
class Solution:
    def __init__(self, rects: 'List[List[int]]'):
        # get the weight of each rectangle
        self.rects = rects
        self.area_sum = []
        area_sum_temp = 0
        for rect in rects:
            #! the weight MUST CONTAIN ALL points
            #! this means the length should be x2 -x1 + 1
            x = abs(rect[2] - rect[0] + 1)
            # note x2, y2 is always > x1, y1 
            y = abs(rect[3] - rect[1] + 1)
            area = x * y
            area_sum_temp += area
            self.area_sum.append(area_sum_temp)

    def pick(self) -> 'List[int]':
        if not self.area_sum:
            return None

        chose_index = self.findRandRect()
        chose_rect = self.rects[chose_index]

        # randomly pick a point in the rectangle
        x1 = chose_rect[0]
        x2 = chose_rect[2]
        if x1 > x2:
            x1, x2 = x2, x1
        new_x = random.randint(x1, x2)
        y1 = chose_rect[1]
        y2 = chose_rect[3]
        if y1 > y2:
            y1, y2 = y2, y1
        new_y = random.randint(y1, y2)
        return [ new_x, new_y ]



    def findRandRect(self):
        """binary search find the rectangle
        normalize the problem: 0 - 10, 11 - 20, 21 - 50, randomly generate a number falls on which block 
        """
        max_sum = self.area_sum[-1]
        target = random.randint(1, max_sum)

        left = 0
        right = len(self.area_sum) - 1
        while left <= right:
            mid = left + int((right- left)/2)
            if target > self.area_sum[mid]:
                left = mid + 1
            elif target < self.area_sum[mid]:
                right = mid - 1
            else:
                return mid
        return right + 1
```
