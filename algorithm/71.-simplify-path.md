# simplify path

[Simplify Path](https://leetcode.com/problems/simplify-path)

Given an absolute path for a file \(Unix-style\), simplify it. Or in other words, convert it to the canonical path.

In a UNIX-style file system, a period . refers to the current directory. Furthermore, a double period .. moves the directory up a level. For more information, see: Absolute path vs relative path in Linux/Unix

Note that the returned canonical path must always begin with a slash /, and there must be only a single slash / between two directory names. The last directory name \(if it exists\) must not end with a trailing /. Also, the canonical path must be the shortest string representing the absolute path.

Example 1:

```text
Input: "/home/"
Output: "/home"
Explanation: Note that there is no trailing slash after the last directory name.
```

Example 2:

```text
Input: "/../"
Output: "/"
Explanation: Going one level up from the root directory is a no-op, as the root level is the highest level you can go.
```

Example 3:

```text
Input: "/home//foo/"
Output: "/home/foo"
Explanation: In the canonical path, multiple consecutive slashes are replaced by a single one.
```

Example 4:

```text
Input: "/a/./b/../../c/"
Output: "/c"
```

Example 5:

```text
Input: "/a/../../b/../c//.//"
Output: "/c"
```

Example 6:

```text
Input: "/a//b////c/d//././/.."
Output: "/a/b/c"
```

## Analysis

## Thoughts

* obviously it's a stack problem 
* **DONT FORGET** 
  * adding item in loop to list based on condition, the last item should be check 
  * when setting up a temp outside the loop, **don't forget that temp after the loop completes**

## Solution

```python
class Solution:
    def simplifyPath(self, path: str) -> str:
        if not path or path == '':
            return '/'

        word_list = []
        current_word = ''
        for c in path:
            if c == '/':
                # current word
                if current_word != '':
                    word_list.append(current_word)
                # reset 
                current_word = ''
            else:
                current_word += c

        # DONT foget !!!!
        if current_word != '':
            word_list.append(current_word)                

        # word stack 
        word_stack = []
        for word in word_list:
            if word == '.':
                continue
            elif word == '..':
                if word_stack:
                    word_stack.pop(-1)
            else:
                word_stack.append(word)

        result = '/'.join(word_stack)
        return '/' + result
```
