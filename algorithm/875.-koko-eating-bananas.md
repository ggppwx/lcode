[Koko Eating Bananas](https://leetcode.com/problems/koko-eating-bananas)

Koko loves to eat bananas. There are N piles of bananas, the i-th pile has piles\[i\] bananas.  
The guards have gone and will come back in H hours. Koko can decide her bananas-per-hour eating speed of K. Each hour, she chooses some pile of bananas, and eats K bananas from that pile. If the pile has less than K bananas, she eats all of them instead, and won't eat any more bananas during this hour. Koko likes to eat slowly, but still wants to finish eating all the bananas before the guards come back. Return the minimum integer K such that she can eat all the bananas within H hours. Example 1:

```text
Input: piles = [3,6,7,11], H = 8
Output: 4
```

Example 2:

```text
Input: piles = [30,11,23,4,20], H = 5
Output: 30
```

Example 3:

```text
Input: piles = [30,11,23,4,20], H = 6
Output: 23
```

## Thoughts

* Binary search the possible number k \(the min Koko can eat \)
* even if the mid meets the condition, since we wanna the min, continue doing binary search 
* Binary search can be split to 
  * 2 conditions Yes/No
  * 3 conditions Greater/Less/Equal 

## Solution

```python
class Solution(object):
    def minEatingSpeed(self, piles, H):

        def possible(k):
            return sum((p-1) / K + 1 for p in piles) <= H

        # binary search 
        low = 1 # at least 
        high = max(piles) # at most 

        # binary search to find the min eating number 
        while low < high:
            mid = int((low + high)/2)
            if not possible(mid):
                low = mid + 1
            else:                
                high = mid
        return low
```
