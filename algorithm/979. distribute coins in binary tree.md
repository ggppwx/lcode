#  distribute coins in binary tree

[Distribute Coins in Binary Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/distribute-coins-in-binary-tree)

Given the root of a binary tree with N nodes, each node in the tree has node.val coins, and there are N coins total. In one move, we may choose two adjacent nodes and move one coin from one node to another. \(The move may be from parent to child, or from child to parent.\)

Return the number of moves required to make every node have exactly one coin. Example 1:

```text
Input: [3,0,0]
Output: 2
```

Explanation: From the root of the tree, we move one coin to its left child, and one coin to its right child.

Example 2:

```text
Input: [0,3,0]
Output: 3
```

Explanation: From the left child of the root, we move two coins to the root \[taking two moves\]. Then, we move one coin from the root of the tree to the right child.

Example 3:

```text
Input: [1,0,2]
Output: 2
```

Example 4:

```text
Input: [1,0,0,null,3]
Output: 4
```

Note: 1&lt;= N &lt;= 100 0 &lt;= node.val &lt;= N

## Thoughts

* Looking at the example

  ```text
         1       2      1
        0  2    0  1   1  1
  ```

* Since it's a tree, it's a good chance to convert it into **sub-problems**
* sub-problem =&gt; To make it balance, we need coins from OUTSIDE, and Add to the **root** of this sub tree

  ```text
        2
      0  0
      offset: -1 + -1 + 1 = -1 
      steps: abs(-1) + abs(-1) = 2 if root has enough.
  ```

* To make the sub tree has enough coin, the steps is left offset + right offest. This can be found by looking at the example 

  ```text
        (2)
        2
      0  0
      offset: 0
      steps: abs(-1) + abs(0) = 1
  ```

## Solution

```python
class Solution:
    # copy the funtion here
    def distributeCoins(self, root: 'TreeNode') -> 'int':
        self.steps = 0
        self.visit(root)
        return self.steps

    def visit(self, node):
        if node == None:
            return 0

        left = self.visit(node.left)
        right = self.visit(node.right)

        self.steps += abs(left) + abs(right)
        offset = node.val - 1
        return left + right + offset
```
