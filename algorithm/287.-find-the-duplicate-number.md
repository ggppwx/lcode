# find the duplicate number

[Find the Duplicate Number](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-duplicate-number)

Given an array nums containing n + 1 integers where each integer is between 1 and n \(inclusive\), prove that at least one duplicate number must exist. Assume that there is only one duplicate number, find the duplicate one.

Example 1:

```text
Input: [1,3,4,2,2]
Output: 2
```

Example 2:

```text
Input: [3,1,3,4,2]
Output: 3
```

Note: You must not modify the array \(assume the array is read only\). You must use only constant, O\(1\) extra space. Your runtime complexity should be less than O\(n2\). There is only one duplicate number in the array, but it could be repeated more than once.

## Analysis

Time: O\(nlogn\)

## Thoughts

* First thought: hashtable.
  * modidfy the array to emulate a fake hash
* No extra space, we could use **binary search**
* it's not a typical binary serach, the high/low are not index but actual values
* solve the problem by example, otherwise it's very easy to make mistakes

  ```text
    1 2 4 4 4, n = 4, mid = (1 + 4)/2 = 2, there are 2 number <= 2,which is NORMAL. target is in (2, 4]

    then, mid = 3, the same logic as above 

    mid = 4, there are 5 numbers <= 4, which is NOT normal, target is in [4,4]
  ```

* why `high = mid` while `low = mid + 1` ?
  * beacuse we always get `floor` of the mid value 

## Solution

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int findDuplicate(vector<int>& nums) {
        // special cases first 
        if (nums.size() == 1) {
            return 0;
        }
        if (nums.size() == 2) {
            return 1;
        }

        int low = 1;
        int high = nums.size() - 1; // n 
        // binary search

        while (low < high) {
            int mid = (low + high) / 2;
            int count = 0;
            for (int num : nums) {
                if (num <= mid) {
                    count ++;
                }
            }
            // 1 2 2 -> count = 1; 1 1 2 -> count = 2
            // target is in [low, high]
            if (count <= mid) {
                low = mid + 1;                
            } else {
                high = mid;
            }
        }
        return high;

    }
};
```
