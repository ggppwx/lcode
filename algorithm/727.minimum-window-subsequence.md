# Minimum Window Subsequence
[Minimum Window Subsequence](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-window-subsequence)

## Analysis
- Brute force O(N*N)
- A better approach is to save the multiple window state 
  - each window starts from `i in range(len(S))`
- the problem is how to find the next index whose value is T[i+1]
  - could be solved by linear  algorithm (DP)
  - backward travesing, save the `letter -> index` dict
    - **deep copy** this object to `index -> map` dict, which presents the state (from i, all letters closest to i )
- time: O(N*T)

## Thoughts
- Always use **is not None** to check if it is none 
- When copyting object, Often Use **deep copy**
- 这道题依然可以图解，本质上是sliding window，但是不同点在于sliding **mulitple** window
- reverse traverse the arry to get an **index map** 

## Solution
```python
class Solution:
    def minWindow(self, S: str, T: str) -> str:
        
        windows = [[None, None]] * len(S)
        for idx, s in enumerate(S):
            if s == T[0]:
                windows[idx] = [idx, idx]
                
        # construct the find map 
        # findmap[idx][letter]
        find = {}
        letter_map = {}
        for i in range(len(S) -1,  -1, -1):
            letter = S[i]
            letter_map[letter] = i
            find[i] = letter_map.copy()
                                                   
                
        for i in range(1, len(T)):                        
            for window in windows:                    
                start = window[0]
                curr = window[1]
                if curr is not None and curr+1 in find and T[i] in find[curr+1]:
                    window[1] = find[curr+1][T[i]]
                else:
                    window[0] = None
                    window[1] = None
                
        result = ""
        #print(windows)
        for window in windows:
            if window[0] is not None:
                tmp = S[window[0]:window[1]+1]
                result = tmp if result == "" or len(tmp) < len(result) else result
                
        return result
```
