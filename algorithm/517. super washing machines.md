#  super washing machines

[Super Washing Machines](https://leetcode.com/problems/super-washing-machines)

You have n super washing machines on a line. Initially, each washing machine has some dresses or is empty. For each move, you could choose any m \(1 ≤ m ≤ n\) washing machines, and pass one dress of each washing machine to one of its adjacent washing machines at the same time . Given an integer array representing the number of dresses in each washing machine from left to right on the line, you should find the minimum number of moves to make all the washing machines have the same number of dresses. If it is not possible to do it, return -1.

Example1

```text
Input: [1,0,5]
Output: 3
```

Explanation:

```text
1st move:    1     0 <-- 5    =>    1     1     4
2nd move:    1 <-- 1 <-- 4    =>    2     1     3    
3rd move:    2     1 <-- 3    =>    2     2     2
```

Example2

```text
Input: [0,3,0]
Output: 2
```

Explanation:

```text
1st move:    0 <-- 3     0    =>    1     2     0    
2nd move:    1     2 --> 0    =>    1     1     1
```

Example3

```text
Input: [0,2,0]
Output: -1
```

Explanation:

```text
It's impossible to make all the three washing machines have the same number of dresses.
```

Note: The range of n is \[1, 10000\]. The range of dresses number in a super washing machine is \[0, 1e5\].

## Analysis

Time: O\(N\)

## Thoughts

* This is a not DP, but a math problem
* Solution2 is easier to understand.
  * it tracks each machine, how many dresses move out, since it one machine can move 

    one dress at a time, \# of move = \# of steps 

## Solution

Using math

```python
class Solution:
    def findMinMoves(self, machines: List[int]) -> int:
        sum_machines = sum(machines)
        if sum_machines % len(machines) != 0:
            return -1

        target = sum_machines/len(machines)
        block_offset = 0
        total_steps = 0
        for machine in machines:
            machine_offset = machine - target # -1 means need 1, +1 means exceed 1 

            # the block from 0 to current pos, it needs block_offset dresses
            # those dresses means steps, because they need to pass i 
            block_offset += machine_offset

            # at current pos, we at least to move abs(block_offset) steps 
            # but if machine > target, at least we need to move (machine - target) steps,
            # meanwhile we need at least move abs(block_offset) steps 
            total_steps = max(total_steps,  max(machine - target, abs(block_offset)) )

        return total_steps
```

solution 2: A easey to understand solution

```python
class Solution:
    def findMinMoves(self, machines: List[int]) -> int:
        sum_machines = sum(machines)
        if sum_machines % len(machines) != 0:
            return -1
        target = int(sum_machines/len(machines))

        toleft = 0
        toright = 0
        # from machine 
        result = 0 
        for machine in machines:
            toright = machine - target - toleft # to right could be negative, but it is fine 
            # if toright < 0, this means NO moving to the right 
            # --2-> X --1->  =>  toright = 1 toleft = -2  
            # 在当前轮，为达到平衡，X 要至少象右移动一个

            # this is to calculate how many dresses MOVED out from current machine 
            # so we only consider Positive value 
            if toleft > 0:
                result = max(result, toleft)
            if toright > 0:
                result = max(result, toright)
            if toleft > 0 and toright > 0:
                result = max(result, toleft + toright)

            # for example, currently moveto right 2, next item, we moveto left = -2  
            toleft = - toright 
        return result
```
