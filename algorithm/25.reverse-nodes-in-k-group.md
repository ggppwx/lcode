# Reverse Nodes in k-Group
[Reverse Nodes in k-Group](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-nodes-in-k-group)

Given a linked list, reverse the nodes of a linked list k at a time and return its modified list.

k is a positive integer and is less than or equal to the length of the linked list. If the number of nodes is not a multiple of k then left-out nodes in the end should remain as it is.

Example:
```
Given this linked list: 1->2->3->4->5

For k = 2, you should return: 2->1->4->3->5

For k = 3, you should return: 3->2->1->4->5
```
Note:
```
Only constant extra memory is allowed.
You may not alter the values in the list's nodes, only nodes itself may be changed.
```
## Analysis
- create a `reverse` function to reverse the linked list 
  - this reverse function returns the new head/tail 
- save the `pre_head` `pre_end` pointer, 

## Thoughts
- create helper functions 
- it's useful to save previous node in linked list problem

## Solution
```python
class Solution:
    def reverseKGroup(self, head: ListNode, k: int) -> ListNode:
        if not head:
            return None
        
        def reverse(node):
            end = node
            pre = None
            while node:
                node_next = node.next
                node.next = pre
                pre = node
                node = node_next
            return pre, end
        
        
        n = head
        count = 1
        pre_h = head
        
        real_head = None
        pre_e = None
        while n:
            n_next = n.next
            if count % k == 0:
                n.next = None
                h, e = reverse(pre_h)
                if pre_e == None:
                    pre_e = e
                    real_head = h   
                else:
                    pre_e.next = h
                    pre_e = e
                    
                pre_h = n_next
            
            n = n_next
            count += 1
            
        if not real_head:
            return head
        
        pre_e.next = pre_h
        return real_head
```
