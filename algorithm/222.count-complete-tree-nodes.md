# Count Complete Tree Nodes
[Count Complete Tree Nodes](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-complete-tree-nodes)

Given a complete binary tree, count the number of nodes.

Note:
Definition of a complete binary tree from Wikipedia:
In a complete binary tree every level, except possibly the last, is completely filled, and all nodes in the last level are as far left as possible. It can have between 1 and 2h nodes inclusive at the last level h.

## Analysis
- simplest solution, go through each node O(N)
- Get the depth, post-order traversal 
    - set the depth when first reach None
- optimization, early quit use a flag `sefl.end`

## Thoughts
- python need to be aware of closure
  - use `nonlocal` if you wanna modify the inmutable variable 
- There might be better solution using O(LogN)^2
  - convert the problem to `1 + count(left) + count(right)`
  - find the end node is on the left-subtree or right-subtree
  - if end node on right subtree, substitue `count(left)` with `2**level - 1`

## Solution
```python
class Solution:
    def countNodes(self, root: TreeNode) -> int:
        
        self.max_level = -1 
        self.count = 0
        self.end = False
        
        def visit(node, level):
            if self.end:
                return 
            
            if node == None:
                # the first time reach None, set the max level 
                if self.max_level == -1:
                    self.max_level = level - 1
                    
                if level != self.max_level + 1:
                    self.end = True
                return 
            
            visit(node.left, level + 1)
            visit(node.right, level + 1)
            
                
            if self.max_level == level:
                self.count += 1        
        
        visit(root, 0)

        if not root:
            return 0 
        
        return 2**self.max_level + self.count - 1
