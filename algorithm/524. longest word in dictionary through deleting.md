# longest word in dictionary through deleting

[Longest Word in Dictionary through Deleting](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-word-in-dictionary-through-deleting) Given a string and a string dictionary, find the longest string in the dictionary that can be formed by deleting some characters of the given string. If there are more than one possible results, return the longest word with the smallest lexicographical order. If there is no possible result, return the empty string.

Example 1:

```text
Input:
s = "abpcplea", d = ["ale","apple","monkey","plea"]

Output: 
"apple"
```

Example 2:

```text
Input:
s = "abpcplea", d = ["a","b","c"]

Output: 
"a"
```

Note: All the strings in the input will only contain lower-case letters. The size of the dictionary won't exceed 1,000. The length of all the strings in the input won't exceed 1,000.

* How to find check if matches ?

  `ssssssss vs ddd` use 2 pointer i tracking s, j tracking d

## Solution

```python
class Solution:
    """
    Sort based on length of the string, then do a "2-pointers" match 
    """
    def findLongestWord(self, s: 'str', d: 'List[str]') -> 'str':
        def match(given, dict_str):
            # 2 pointers compare if the dict_str is in given  
            i = 0
            j = 0
            while  i < len(given) and j < len(dict_str):
                if given[i] == dict_str[j]:
                    j += 1
                i += 1

            if j != len(dict_str):
                return False

            return True

        d = sorted(d, key = lambda x : (-len(x), x))
        for dict_str in d:
            if match(s, dict_str):
                return dict_str

        return ''
```
