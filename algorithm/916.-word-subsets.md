# word subsets

[916 Word Subsets](https://leetcode.com/problems/word-subsets/)

We are given two arrays A and B of words. Each word is a string of lowercase letters. Now, say that word b is a subset of word a if every letter in b occurs in a, including multiplicity. For example, "wrr" is a subset of "warrior", but is not a subset of "world". Now say a word a from A is universal if for every b in B, b is a subset of a. Return a list of all universal words in A. You can return the words in any order.

Example 1:

```text
Input: A = ["amazon","apple","facebook","google","leetcode"], B = ["e","o"]
Output: ["facebook","google","leetcode"]
```

Example 2:

```text
Input: A = ["amazon","apple","facebook","google","leetcode"], B = ["l","e"]
Output: ["apple","google","leetcode"]
```

Example 3:

```text
Input: A = ["amazon","apple","facebook","google","leetcode"], B = ["e","oo"]
Output: ["facebook","google"]
```

Example 4:

```text
Input: A = ["amazon","apple","facebook","google","leetcode"], B = ["lo","eo"]
Output: ["google","leetcode"]
```

Example 5:

```text
Input: A = ["amazon","apple","facebook","google","leetcode"], B = ["ec","oc","ceo"]
Output: ["facebook","leetcode"]
```

## Analysis
time O\(N^2\)

## Thoughts
* we deduce all the info of list B into a single map. 
* Use the right variable in the loop
* we can come up the solution with brute force and give the Time complexity. then ask for hint

## Solution
Better solution

```python
class Solution:
    def wordSubsets(self, A: List[str], B: List[str]) -> List[str]:
        import collections
        char_counter_B = collections.Counter()

        # B = [ec, oc, ceoc]
        for b in B:
            temp = collections.Counter()
            for char_in_b in b:
                temp[char_in_b] += 1
            # temp -> e:1 c:1
            # temp -> o:1 c:1
            # temp -> c:2 e:1 o:1

            for char_in_b in temp:
                # be ware, use the right variable 
                if temp.get(char_in_b) > char_counter_B.get(char_in_b, 0):
                    char_counter_B[char_in_b] = temp.get(char_in_b)
            # char_counter_B -> e:1 c:1
            # char_counter_B -> e:1 c:1 o:1
            # char_counter_B -> e:1 c:2 o:1
        
        # the final char_counter_B is a dict for each key has the largest value
        result = []
        for a in A:
            a_counter = collections.Counter()
            for c in a:
                a_counter[c] += 1
            match = True
            for c in char_counter_B:
                # we only need to compare if a_counter has enough number of char (in B)
                if char_counter_B[c] > a_counter.get(c, 0):
                    match = False
            if match:
                result.append(a)
        return result
```
