# domino and tromino tiling

[Domino and Tromino Tiling](https://leetcode.com/problems/domino-and-tromino-tiling)

We have two types of tiles: a 2x1 domino shape, and an "L" tromino shape. These shapes may be rotated.

```text
XX  <- domino

XX  <- "L" tromino
X
```

Given N, how many ways are there to tile a 2 x N board? Return your answer modulo 10^9 + 7.

\(In a tiling, every square must be covered by a tile. Two tilings are different if and only if there are two 4-directionally adjacent cells on the board such that exactly one of the tilings has both squares occupied by a tile.\)

```text
Example:
Input: 3
Output: 5
Explanation: 
The five different ways are listed below, different letters indicates different tiles:
XYZ XXZ XYY XXY XYY
XYZ YYZ XZZ XYY XXY
```

Note:

```text
N  will be in range [1, 1000].
```

  Use P\(3,3\) to indicate the 2 \* 3 board

  P\(3,3\) = P\(2,2\) + P\(1,2\) + P\(2,1\) + P\(1,1\) + P\(1,1\)

## Solution
```python
class Solution:
    def numTilings(self, N: int) -> int:
        if N == 0:
            return 0
        if N == 1:
            return 1

        P = [[0 for _ in range(l+1)] for _ in range(l+1)]
        P[0][0] = 1
        P[0][1] = 0
        P[1][0] = 0
        P[1][1] = 1
        P[1][2] = 1
        P[2][1] = 1
        for i in range(2,N+1):
            for j in range(2, N+1):
                if abs(i - j) >= 2:
                    P[i][j] = 0
                    continue
                if abs(i-j) == 1:
                    if i > j:
                        P[i][j] = P[i-2][j-1] + P[i-2][j]
                    else:
                        P[i][j] = P[i-1][j-2] + P[i][j-2]
                    continue
                P[i][j] = P[i-1][j-1] + P[i-2][j-2] + P[i-1][j-2] + P[i-2][j-1]

        return P[N][N] % (10**9 + 7)
```
