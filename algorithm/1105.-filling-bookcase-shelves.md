# filling bookcase shelves

[Filling Bookcase Shelves](https://leetcode.com/problems/filling-bookcase-shelves)

We have a sequence of books: the i-th book has thickness books\[i\]\[0\] and height books\[i\]\[1\].

We want to place these books in order onto bookcase shelves that have total width shelf\_width.

We choose some of the books to place on this shelf \(such that the sum of their thickness is &lt;= shelf\_width\), then build another level of shelf of the bookcase so that the total height of the bookcase has increased by the maximum height of the books we just put down. We repeat this process until there are no more books to place.

Note again that at each step of the above process, the order of the books we place is the same order as the given sequence of books. For example, if we have an ordered list of 5 books, we might place the first and second book onto the first shelf, the third book on the second shelf, and the fourth and fifth book on the last shelf.

Return the minimum possible height that the total bookshelf can be after placing shelves in this manner.

    def minHeightShelves(self, books: List[List[int]], shelf_width: int) -> int:
        if not books:
            return 0
        
        dp = [0] * len(books)
        # dp(i): min height ending with i 
        # j the current level starts with j 
        for i in range(len(books)):
            # assuem j is the start of current level
            curr_level_width = 0
            max_curr_level_height = 0 
            min_height = 100000000
            for j in range(i,-1,-1):
                # j is between [i,0]
                book = books[j]                
                curr_level_width += book[0]
                
                if curr_level_width <= shelf_width:
                    max_curr_level_height = max(max_curr_level_height, book[1])
                    if j == 0:
                        min_height = min(min_height, max_curr_level_height)
                    else:
                        min_height = min(min_height, dp[j-1] +  max_curr_level_height)
                else:
                    break
            
            # all j possibilities
            dp[i] = min_height 
            
        return dp[len(books)-1] if dp[len(books)-1] < 100000000 else None
```

```python
class Solution:
    def minHeightShelves(self, books: List[List[int]], shelf_width: int) -> int:
        self.result = 1000000000
        def gen(i, current_width, current_height, pre_level_total_height):
            if current_height + pre_level_total_height > self.result:
                return

            if i == len(books):
                # exceeding last book 
                self.result = min( self.result, pre_level_total_height + current_height)
                return 


            book = books[i]
            if current_width + book[0] <= shelf_width:
                # put into the same level 
                new_current_height = max(current_height, book[1])
                gen(i+1, current_width + book[0], new_current_height, pre_level_total_height )

            # new level 
            gen(i+1, book[0], book[1], pre_level_total_height + current_height)

        gen(0, 0, 0, 0)
        return self.result
