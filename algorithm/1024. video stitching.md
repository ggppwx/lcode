# video stitching

[Video Stitching](https://leetcode.com/problems/video-stitching)

You are given a series of video clips from a sporting event that lasted T seconds. These video clips can be overlapping with each other and have varied lengths.

Each video clip clips\[i\] is an interval: it starts at time clips\[i\]\[0\] and ends at time clips\[i\]\[1\]. We can cut these clips into segments freely: for example, a clip \[0, 7\] can be cut into segments \[0, 1\] + \[1, 3\] + \[3, 7\].

Return the minimum number of clips needed so that we can cut the clips into segments that cover the entire sporting event \(\[0, T\]\). If the task is impossible, return -1.

Example 1:

```text
Input: clips = [[0,2],[4,6],[8,10],[1,9],[1,5],[5,9]], T = 10
Output: 3
Explanation: 
We take the clips [0,2], [8,10], [1,9]; a total of 3 clips.
Then, we can reconstruct the sporting event as follows:
We cut [1,9] into segments [1,2] + [2,8] + [8,9].
Now we have segments [0,2] + [2,8] + [8,10] which cover the sporting event [0, 10].
```

Example 2:

```text
Input: clips = [[0,1],[1,2]], T = 5
Output: -1
Explanation: 
We can't cover [0,5] with only [0,1] and [0,2].
```

Example 3:

```text
Input: clips = [[0,1],[6,8],[0,2],[5,6],[0,4],[0,3],[6,7],[1,3],[4,7],[1,4],[2,5],[2,6],[3,4],[4,5],[5,7],[6,9]], T = 9
Output: 3
Explanation: 
We can take clips [0,4], [4,7], and [6,9].
```

Example 4:

```text
Input: clips = [[0,4],[2,8]], T = 5
Output: 2
Explanation: 
Notice you can have extra video after the event ends.
```

Note: 1 &lt;= clips.length &lt;= 100 0 &lt;= clips\[i\]\[0\], clips\[i\]\[1\] &lt;= 100 0 &lt;= T &lt;= 100

## Analysis

Time: O\(N\) + O\(nlogn\)

## Thoughts

* Greedy solution \(better solution\):
  * find the furthest clip when start &lt; condition
  * can be more clear, introducing `findFurthestEnd(max_start, clips)` method 
* DP function: at clip i, it can at most covers. but it also requires sort first
* `DP(i) = max(DP(i-1), c[i][1] if c[i][0] <= DP(i-1) )`
  * `DP(i)` is valid, so only check if it can reach T

## Solution

```python
class Solution:
    def videoStitching(self, clips: List[List[int]], T: int) -> int:
        # sorted by start of each clip
        clips = sorted(clips, key = lambda clip : clip[0])

        # greedy, always find largest end meets start <= max_start
        max_start = 0
        max_end = -1
        count = 0
        i = 0
        while i < len(clips):
            clip = clips[i]
            start = clip[0]
            end = clip[1]
            if start <= max_start:
                # the chip is good
                if max_end < end:
                    max_end = end

                i += 1
            else:
                # this chip doesn't work 
                if max_end == -1:
                    # No chip satisfy the condition
                    return -1

                count += 1

                if max_end >= T:
                    return count

                # we need to reset max_start, because this chip doesn't 
                # satisfy PREVIOUS max_start
                # no any more
                max_start = max_end
                max_end = -1 
                continue

        count += 1
        if max_end >= T:
            return count

        return -1
```
