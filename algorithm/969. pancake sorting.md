# Pancake Sorting

[Pancake Sorting](https://leetcode.com/problems/pancake-sorting) Given an array A, we can perform a pancake flip: We choose some positive integer k &lt;= A.length, then reverse the order of the first k elements of A. We want to perform zero or more pancake flips \(doing them one after another in succession\) to sort the array A. Return the k-values corresponding to a sequence of pancake flips that sort A. Any valid answer that sorts the array within 10 \* A.length flips will be judged as correct.

Example 1:

```text
Input: [3,2,4,1]
Output: [4,2,4,3]
Explanation: 
We perform 4 pancake flips, with k values 4, 2, 4, and 3.
Starting state: A = [3, 2, 4, 1]
After 1st flip (k=4): A = [1, 4, 2, 3]
After 2nd flip (k=2): A = [4, 1, 2, 3]
After 3rd flip (k=4): A = [3, 2, 1, 4]
After 4th flip (k=3): A = [1, 2, 3, 4], which is sorted.
```

Example 2:

```text
Input: [1,2,3]
Output: []
Explanation: The input is already sorted, so there is no need to flip anything.
Note that other answers, such as [3, 3], would also be accepted.
```

Note:

```text
1 <= A.length <= 100
A[i] is a permutation of [1, 2, ..., A.length]
```

## Thoughts

* looking at the last the digit, once it is done, do not sort 
* then the problem becomes how to make the last digit done ?
  * find the expected last digit
  * move it to the first 
  * move it to last 

## Solution

```python
class Solution:
    """
    An interesting problem. 
    The key is to find the maximum value, and put it to the end:
    1. if it's already in the end, no move
    2. if it's in the head, swap to the end 
    3. otherwise swap to the head
