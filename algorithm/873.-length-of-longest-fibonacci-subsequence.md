# length of longest fibonacci subsequence

[Length of Longest Fibonacci Subsequence](https://leetcode.com/problems/length-of-longest-fibonacci-subsequence)

A sequence X_1, X\_2, ..., X\_n is fibonacci-like if: n &gt;= 3 X\_i + X_{i+1} = X\_{i+2} for all i + 2 &lt;= n Given a strictly increasing array A of positive integers forming a sequence, find the length of the longest fibonacci-like subsequence of A. If one does not exist, return 0.

\(Recall that a subsequence is derived from another sequence A by deleting any number of elements \(including none\) from A, without changing the order of the remaining elements. For example, \[3, 5, 8\] is a subsequence of \[3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8\].\)

Example 1:

```text
Input: [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]
Output: 5
Explanation:
The longest subsequence that is fibonacci-like: [1,2,3,5,8].
```

Example 2:

```text
Input: [1,3,7,11,12,14,18]
Output: 3
Explanation:
The longest subsequence that is fibonacci-like:
[1,11,12], [3,11,14] or [7,11,18].
```

Note:

```text
3 <= A.length <= 1000
1 <= A[0] < A[1] < ... < A[A.length - 1] <= 10^9
(The time limit has been reduced by 50% for submissions in Java, C, and C++.)
```

## Analysis
- Time: O\(N^2\)
- `Ak, ..... Aj, ..... Ai` so `DP(j, i) => length contains j, i`
  - `DP(j, i) = DP(k,j) + 1 if i,j,k is fab`
  - the final result will consider all combinations of \(i,j\)
- Fab is about 3 pointers, we can convert it to 2 pointers DP
  - `Ak = Ai - Aj` if `k < j`, getting `k` by using map  

## Thoughts
* Be aware of how fab constructed
  * Ak = A\_i - A\_j, not calculating the diff !!
* Once you get \(i,j\), you can calulate \(j,k\)
  * state function =&gt; the max length for picking i, j 
* `0 --> False` Be careful when checking index
  * always explicitly check `if k is not None` !
* The solution below is a little confusing. better to use the formula above 
  
## Solution
```python
class Solution:
    def lenLongestFibSubseq(self, A: List[int]) -> int:
        # DP(i, j ) =  max(DP (j, k) + 1) if A[i] - A[j] == A[k]
        index_map = { a : idx for idx, a in enumerate(A)}
        DP = [[1 for _ in range(len(A))] for _ in range(len(A))]
        for i, a in enumerate(A, start=0):
            for j in range(i): # [0, i-1]  
                DP[i][j] = 2
                A_k = A[i] - A[j]
                k = index_map.get(A_k)
                if k != None :  # shit happens here !!
                    DP[i][j] = DP[j][k] + 1


        result =  0
        for i in range(len(DP)):
            for j in range(i):
                #print (DP[i][j])
                result  = max(result, DP[i][j])

        return result if result > 2 else 0
```
