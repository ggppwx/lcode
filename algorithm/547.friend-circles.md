# Friend Circles
[Friend Circles](https://leetcode.com/problems/friend-circles)
There are N students in a class. Some of them are friends, while some are not. Their friendship is transitive in nature. For example, if A is a direct friend of B, and B is a direct friend of C, then A is an indirect friend of C. And we defined a friend circle is a group of students who are direct or indirect friends.

Given a N*N matrix M representing the friend relationship between students in the class. If M[i][j] = 1, then the ith and jth students are direct friends with each other, otherwise not. And you have to output the total number of friend circles among all the students.

Example 1:
```
Input: 
[[1,1,0],
 [1,1,0],
 [0,0,1]]
Output: 2
Explanation:The 0th and 1st students are direct friends, so they are in a friend circle. 
The 2nd student himself is in a friend circle. So return 2.
```

## Analysis
* union to create multiple trees
* find root for each node 


## Thoughts
* Union-find is to determine the number of connected components in graph 

## Solution
```python
class Solution:
    def findCircleNum(self, M: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        N = len(M)
        parent = [i in for i in range(N)] # 0 - N-1

        def find(node):
            if parent[node] == node:
                return node
            return find(parent[node])

        def union(left, right):
            left_root = find(left)
            right_root = find(right)
            if left_root != right_root:
                parent[left_root] = right_root

        
        for i in range(N):
            for j in range(N):
                if M[i][j] == 1:
                    # knows each other. union
                    union(i, j)

        result_map = {}
        for node in range(N):
            root = find(node)
            result_map[root] = True
        
        return len(result_map)
                
```
