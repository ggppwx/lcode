# design circular queue

[Design Circular Queue](https://leetcode.com/problems/design-circular-queue)

Design your implementation of the circular queue. The circular queue is a linear data structure in which the operations are performed based on FIFO \(First In First Out\) principle and the last position is connected back to the first position to make a circle. It is also called "Ring Buffer".

One of the benefits of the circular queue is that we can make use of the spaces in front of the queue. In a normal queue, once the queue becomes full, we cannot insert the next element even if there is a space in front of the queue. But using the circular queue, we can use the space to store new values.

Your implementation should support following operations:

MyCircularQueue\(k\): Constructor, set the size of the queue to be k. Front: Get the front item from the queue. If the queue is empty, return -1. Rear: Get the last item from the queue. If the queue is empty, return -1. enQueue\(value\): Insert an element into the circular queue. Return true if the operation is successful. deQueue\(\): Delete an element from the circular queue. Return true if the operation is successful. isEmpty\(\): Checks whether the circular queue is empty or not. isFull\(\): Checks whether the circular queue is full or not.

Example:

```text
MyCircularQueue circularQueue = new MyCircularQueue(3); // set the size to be 3
circularQueue.enQueue(1);  // return true
circularQueue.enQueue(2);  // return true
circularQueue.enQueue(3);  // return true
circularQueue.enQueue(4);  // return false, the queue is full
circularQueue.Rear();  // return 3
circularQueue.isFull();  // return true
circularQueue.deQueue();  // return true
circularQueue.enQueue(4);  // return true
circularQueue.Rear();  // return 4
```

Note:

```text
All values will be in the range of [0, 1000].
The number of operations will be in the range of [1, 1000].
Please do not use the built-in Queue library.
```

## Analysis

## Thoughts

* at first, I am thinking to have a start and end, but it seems harder to track the

  size

* so why not directly tracking the size of the queue as an member variable ?
  * so end = front + size 

## Solution

```python
class MyCircularQueue:

    def __init__(self, k: int):
        """
        Initialize your data structure here. Set the size of the queue to be k.
        """
        self.K = k
        self.queue = [None] * k
        self.front = -1
        self.size = 0

    def enQueue(self, value: int) -> bool:
        """
        Insert an element into the circular queue. Return true if the operation is successful.
        """
        if self.size == self.K:
            return False

        self.size += 1
        self.queue[(self.front + self.size) % self.K] = value
        return True


    def deQueue(self) -> bool:
        """
        Delete an element from the circular queue. Return true if the operation is successful.
        """
        if self.size == 0:
            return False

        self.size -= 1
        self.front = (self.front + 1) % self.K
        return True


    def Front(self) -> int:
        """
        Get the front item from the queue.
        """
        if self.isEmpty():
            return -1
        return self.queue[(self.front + 1) % self.K]

    def Rear(self) -> int:
        """
        Get the last item from the queue.
        """
        if self.isEmpty():
            return -1
        return self.queue[(self.front + self.size) % self.K] 

    def isEmpty(self) -> bool:
        """
        Checks whether the circular queue is empty or not.
        """
        return self.size == 0


    def isFull(self) -> bool:
        """
        Checks whether the circular queue is full or not.
        """
        return self.size == self.K



# Your MyCircularQueue object will be instantiated and called as such:
# obj = MyCircularQueue(k)
# param_1 = obj.enQueue(value)
# param_2 = obj.deQueue()
# param_3 = obj.Front()
# param_4 = obj.Rear()
# param_5 = obj.isEmpty()
# param_6 = obj.isFull()
```
