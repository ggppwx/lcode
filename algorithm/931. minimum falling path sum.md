[Minimum Falling Path Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-falling-path-sum)

Given a square array of integers A, we want the minimum sum of a falling path through A.

A falling path starts at any element in the first row, and chooses one element from each row. The next row's choice must be in a column that is different from the previous row's column by at most one.

Example 1:

```text
Input: [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]]
Output: 12
Explanation: 
The possible falling paths are:
[1,4,7], [1,4,8], [1,5,7], [1,5,8], [1,5,9]
[2,4,7], [2,4,8], [2,5,7], [2,5,8], [2,5,9], [2,6,8], [2,6,9]
[3,5,7], [3,5,8], [3,5,9], [3,6,8], [3,6,9]
The falling path with the smallest sum is [1,4,7], so the answer is 12.
```

Note:

```text
1 <= A.length == A[0].length <= 100
-100 <= A[i][j] <= 100
```

## Analysis

## Thoughts

* Typical DP. Instantly figure out we need a state formula
* DP =&gt; minimun value ending at position \(i, j\)

## Solution

```python
class Solution:
    def minFallingPathSum(self, A: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        # DP(i, j) = min(DP(i-1, j-1), DP(i-1, j), DP(i+1, j))
        if not A:
            return 0

        DP = [[0 for _ in range(len(A[0]))] for _ in range(len(A)) ]
        INT_MAX = 100000000
        for i in range(len(A)):            
            for j in range(len(A[i])):
                if i == 0:
                    DP[i][j] = A[i][j]
                    continue

                DP_j_1 = DP[i-1][j-1] if j > 0 else INT_MAX
                DP_j_2 = DP[i-1][j]
                DP_j_3 = DP[i-1][j+1] if j < len(A[i]) - 1 else INT_MAX
                DP[i][j] = min(DP_j_1, DP_j_2, DP_j_3) + A[i][j]


        return min(DP[len(A)-1])
```
