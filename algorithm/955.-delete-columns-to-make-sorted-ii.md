# delete columns to make sorted ii

[Delete Columns to Make Sorted II](https://leetcode.com/problems/delete-columns-to-make-sorted-ii)

We are given an array A of N lowercase letter strings, all of the same length.

Now, we may choose any set of deletion indices, and for each string, we delete all the characters in those indices.

For example, if we have an array A = \["abcdef","uvwxyz"\] and deletion indices {0, 2, 3}, then the final array after deletions is \["bef","vyz"\].

Suppose we chose a set of deletion indices D such that after deletions, the final array has its elements in lexicographic order \(A\[0\] &lt;= A\[1\] &lt;= A\[2\] ... &lt;= A\[A.length - 1\]\).

Return the minimum possible value of D.length.

Example 1:

```text
Input: ["ca","bb","ac"]
Output: 1
Explanation: 
After deleting the first column, A = ["a", "b", "c"].
Now A is in lexicographic order (ie. A[0] <= A[1] <= A[2]).
We require at least 1 deletion since initially A was not in lexicographic order, so the answer is 1.
```

Example 2:

```text
Input: ["xc","yb","za"]
Output: 0
Explanation: 
A is already in lexicographic order, so we don't need to delete anything.
Note that the rows of A are not necessarily in lexicographic order:
ie. it is NOT necessarily true that (A[0][0] <= A[0][1] <= ...)
```

Example 3:

```text
Input: ["zyx","wvu","tsr"]
Output: 3
Explanation: 
We have to delete every column.
```

## Analysis
- so basically we look at each character one by one 

## Thoughts

* solution 2
  * 钻牛角尖了
  * beaware of that you only need to compare when previous row is equal 
* solution 1
  * Use x vs x+1 to compare 
  * pass by reference 
  * instead of comparing the single column, you compare multiple column **UNLESS**  deleted
    * the problem becomes for each new column, should we add it ? 
      * after we add the column, check if it is\_sorted
      * python lexicographic compare: `< = >`

## Solution

* simpler solution

  ```python
  class Solution:
    def minDeletionSize(self, A: List[str]) -> int:
        # [c, b, a]
        def is_sorted(curr):
            return all(curr[i] <= curr[i+1] for i in range(len(A)-1))

        N = len(A[0])
        L = len(A)
        result = 0
        curr = [""] * L        
        for i in range(N):            
            pre = list(curr)
            for l in range(L):
                curr[l] += A[l][i]
            #print(curr)

            if not is_sorted(curr):
                # reset the current back 
                result += 1
                curr = pre

        return result
  ```
