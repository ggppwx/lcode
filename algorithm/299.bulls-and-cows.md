# Bulls and Cows
[Bulls and Cows](https://leetcode.com/problems/bulls-and-cows)

Please note that both secret number and friend's guess may contain duplicate digits.
```
Example 1:
Input: secret = "1807", guess = "7810"
Output: "1A3B"
Explanation: 1 bull and 3 cows. The bull is 8, the cows are 0, 1 and 7.

Example 2:
Input: secret = "1123", guess = "0111"
Output: "1A1B"
Explanation: The 1st 1 in friend's guess is a bull, the 2nd or 3rd 1 is a cow.
Note: You may assume that the secret number and your friend's guess only contain digits, and their lengths are always equal.
```
## Analysis
- first iteration get all bulls
- then get all cows
  - second loop need to **exclude** bull cases

## Thoughts
- 不用取巧，用multiple loop 没有任何坏处
- Putting bull/cow check may cause **interference**


## Solution
```python
class Solution:
    def getHint(self, secret: str, guess: str) -> str:
        s_map = {}
        for s in secret:
            s_map[s] = s_map.get(s, 0) + 1
            
        bull = 0
        cow = 0
        for i, g in enumerate(guess):
            if i < len(secret) and g == secret[i]:
                # bull
                bull += 1
                s_map[g] = s_map[g] - 1
                
        for i, g in enumerate(guess):
            if i < len(secret) and g != secret[i] and g in s_map and s_map[g] > 0:
                cow += 1
                s_map[g] = s_map[g] - 1
                
        return str(bull) + 'A' + str(cow) + 'B'
```
