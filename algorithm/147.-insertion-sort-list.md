# insertion sort list

[Insertion Sort List](https://leetcode.com/problems/insertion-sort-list)

Algorithm of Insertion Sort: Insertion sort iterates, consuming one input element each repetition, and growing a sorted output list. At each iteration, insertion sort removes one element from the input data, finds the location it belongs within the sorted list, and inserts it there. It repeats until no input elements remain.

## Analysis

O\(N^2\)

## Thoughts

* typical linked list problem. 
* easy to make mistakes during inserting !!
  * it's not make the last tmp\_curr.next = new\_curr 
* So for the main interation, you need to keep pre & curr 
* my first thought is correct 

```text
d -> 4 -> (2) -> 1   => d-> 2 -> <- 4  (1) => d -> 2 -> 4 -> 1

d -> 4 -> 5 -> (2) -> 1 => d -> 2 -> 4 -> (2<-)5  (1) => d -> 2 -> 4 ->5 -> (1)
```

## Solution

```python
class Solution:
    def insertionSortList(self, head: ListNode) -> ListNode:
        # corner case 
        if not head:
            return None

        # dummy node 
        dummy = ListNode(0)
        dummy.next = head

        # starting from   
        pre = dummy      
        curr = head

        while curr:
            # compare curr vs [head -> curr)
            tmp_pre = dummy
            tmp_curr = dummy.next
            found = False
            while tmp_curr != curr:
                if tmp_curr.val > curr.val:
                    found = True
                    curr_next = curr.next
                    tmp_pre.next = curr
                    curr.next = tmp_curr

                    # set pre.next
                    pre.next = curr_next

                    # set the curr 
                    curr = curr_next
                    break

                # move
                tmp_curr = tmp_curr.next
                tmp_pre = tmp_pre.next


            if not found:
                curr = curr.next
                pre = pre.next

        return dummy.next
```
