# all possible full binary trees

[All Possible Full Binary Trees](https://leetcode.com/problems/all-possible-full-binary-trees)

A full binary tree is a binary tree where each node has exactly 0 or 2 children. Return a list of all possible full binary trees with N nodes. Each element of the answer is the root node of one possible tree. Each node of each tree in the answer must have node.val = 0. You may return the final list of trees in any order.

## Thoughts

* obviously it's a recursion
* convert problem to sub-problem

  ```text
  alltrees(n) => alltrees(1) + alltrees(n-1-1)
  ```

## Solution

```python
class Solution:
    # copy the funtion here
    def allPossibleFBT(self, N):
        """
        Thinking as sub-problem
        left, right all possible trees are sub-problems 
        """
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.left = None
#         self.right = None

class Solution:
    def allPossibleFBT(self, N: int) -> List[TreeNode]:
        # exit condition and corner case
        if N == 0:
            return [] 
        if N == 1:
            return [TreeNode(0)]
        if N == 2:
            return []

        result = []
        for left_count in range(1,N-1):
            right_count = N - 1 -left_count
            for l_node in self.allPossibleFBT(left_count):
                for r_node in self.allPossibleFBT(right_count):
                    newnode = TreeNode(0)
                    newnode.left = l_node
                    newnode.right = r_node
                    result.append(newnode)

        return result
```
