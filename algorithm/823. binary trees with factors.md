#  binary trees with factors

[Binary Trees With Factors](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-trees-with-factors)

Given an array of unique integers, each integer is strictly greater than 1.

We make a binary tree using these integers and each number may be used for any number of times.

Each non-leaf node's value should be equal to the product of the values of it's children.

How many binary trees can we make? Return the answer modulo 10 \*\* 9 + 7.

Example 1:

```text
Input: A = [2, 4]
Output: 3
Explanation: We can make these trees: [2], [4], [4, 2, 2]
```

Example 2:

```text
Input: A = [2, 4, 5, 10]
Output: 7
Explanation: We can make these trees: [2], [4], [5], [10], [4, 2, 2], [10, 2, 5], [10, 5, 2].
```

Note:

```text
1 <= A.length <= 1000.
2 <= A[i] <= 10 ^ 9.
```

## Analysis

Time: O\(N^2\)

## Thoughts

* DP, solving by example:

  ```text
  [2, 4] 
  2: 2    =>  1
  4: 4, 2-4-2 => 1 + P(2)* P(2) = 2
  16:
  16,   16      16     16        16
     4  4    4  4   4  4      4  4
            2 2       2 2    2 2 2 2
  P(16) => 1 + P(4) * P(4) = 5
  ```

* the state index i in P\(i\) is huge, so instead of crating an array,

  Use map 

* Tree, think sub-problem `P(a) = 1 + all(P(left) * P(right))`

## Solution

```python
class Solution:
    def numFactoredBinaryTrees(self, A: List[int]) -> int:
        A = sorted(A)
        P = {}
        for a in A:
            P[a] = 1

        for idx, a in enumerate(A):
            if idx == 0:
                P[a] = 1
                continue

            temp = 1
            for i in range(0, idx):
                left = A[i]
                if a % left == 0:
                    right = a/left
                    if right in P:
                        temp += P[left] * P[right] 

            P[a] = temp 

        result = 0
        for key in P:
            result += P[key]

        return  result % (10 ** 9 + 7)
```
