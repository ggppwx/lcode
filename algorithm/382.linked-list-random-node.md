# Linked List Random Node
[Linked List Random Node](https://leetcode.com/problems/linked-list-random-node)

Given a singly linked list, return a random node's value from the linked list. Each node must have the same probability of being chosen.

Follow up:
What if the linked list is extremely large and its length is unknown to you? Could you solve this efficiently without using extra space?

## Analysis
- reservoir sampling
  - [a simple tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1iwzSew5QY)
  - 1 node. 100%
  - 2 node. 50%
  - 3 node. 1/3
- need to re-draw every time
- after i times, get the 1/[1,i] possibility to get the hat 


## Thoughts
- original problem is easy.
- hard part is to use reservoir sampling

## Solution
```python
class Solution:

    def __init__(self, head: ListNode):
        """
        @param head The linked list's head.
        Note that the head is guaranteed to be not null, so it contains at least one node.
        """
        self.head = head


    def getRandom(self) -> int:
        """
        Returns a random node's value.
        """
        node = self.head
        count = 0
        result = self.head.val
        while node:
            if random.randrange(0, count+1) == 0:
                result = node.val
            count += 1
            node = node.next
        return result
```
