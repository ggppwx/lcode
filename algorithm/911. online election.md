[Online Election](https://leetcode.com/problems/online-election)

In an election, the i-th vote was cast for persons\[i\] at time times\[i\]. Now, we would like to implement the following query function: TopVotedCandidate.q\(int t\) will return the number of the person that was leading the election at time t.  
Votes cast at time t will count towards our query. In the case of a tie, the most recent vote \(among tied candidates\) wins.

Example 1:

```text
Input: ["TopVotedCandidate","q","q","q","q","q","q"], [[[0,1,1,0,0,1,0],[0,5,10,15,20,25,30]],[3],[12],[25],[15],[24],[8]]
Output: [null,0,1,1,0,0,1]
Explanation: 
At time 3, the votes are [0], and 0 is leading.
At time 12, the votes are [0,1,1], and 1 is leading.
At time 25, the votes are [0,1,1,0,0,1], and 1 is leading (as ties go to the most recent vote.)
This continues for 3 more queries at time 15, 24, and 8.
```

Note: 1 &lt;= persons.length = times.length &lt;= 5000 0 &lt;= persons\[i\] &lt;= persons.length times is a strictly increasing array with all elements in \[0, 10^9\]. TopVotedCandidate.q is called at most 10000 times per test case. TopVotedCandidate.q\(int t\) is always called with t &gt;= times\[0\].

## Thoughts

* Binary search could also be `while low <= high`
* find the small side of a range 

## Solution

```python
class TopVotedCandidate:
    """
    Get a list of leading person at each time max_persons
    Then do binary search.
    Be aware: binary serach's boundary case: start == end, 
    """
    def __init__(self, persons: 'List[int]', times: 'List[int]'):
        count = {}
        max_person = -1
        max_count = 0
        self.max_persons = []
        for p in persons:
            count[p] = count.get(p, 0) + 1
            if count[p] >= max_count:
                max_count = count[p]
                max_person = p
            self.max_persons.append(max_person)
        self.times = times
        self.persons = persons

    def q(self, t: 'int') -> 'int':
        if len(self.max_persons) == 0:
            return None

        low = 0
        high = len(self.times) - 1
        while (low <= high):
            mid = int((low + high) / 2)
            if t > self.times[mid]:
                low = mid + 1
            elif t < self.times[mid]:
                high = mid - 1
            else:
                return self.max_persons[mid]

        """the value is between [high , low )
        don't forget to check if high < 0
        """
        if high < 0:
            return None
        return self.max_persons[high]
```
