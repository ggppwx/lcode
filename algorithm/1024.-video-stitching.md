# video stitching

[Video Stitching](https://leetcode.com/problems/video-stitching)

You are given a series of video clips from a sporting event that lasted T seconds. These video clips can be overlapping with each other and have varied lengths.

Each video clip clips\[i\] is an interval: it starts at time clips\[i\]\[0\] and ends at time clips\[i\]\[1\]. We can cut these clips into segments freely: for example, a clip \[0, 7\] can be cut into segments \[0, 1\] + \[1, 3\] + \[3, 7\].

Return the minimum number of clips needed so that we can cut the clips into segments that cover the entire sporting event \(\[0, T\]\). If the task is impossible, return -1.

Example 1:

```text
Input: clips = [[0,2],[4,6],[8,10],[1,9],[1,5],[5,9]], T = 10
Output: 3
Explanation: 
We take the clips [0,2], [8,10], [1,9]; a total of 3 clips.
Then, we can reconstruct the sporting event as follows:
We cut [1,9] into segments [1,2] + [2,8] + [8,9].
Now we have segments [0,2] + [2,8] + [8,10] which cover the sporting event [0, 10].
```

Example 2:

```text
Input: clips = [[0,1],[1,2]], T = 5
Output: -1
Explanation: 
We can't cover [0,5] with only [0,1] and [0,2].
```

Example 3:

```text
Input: clips = [[0,1],[6,8],[0,2],[5,6],[0,4],[0,3],[6,7],[1,3],[4,7],[1,4],[2,5],[2,6],[3,4],[4,5],[5,7],[6,9]], T = 9
Output: 3
Explanation: 
We can take clips [0,4], [4,7], and [6,9].
```

Example 4:

```text
Input: clips = [[0,4],[2,8]], T = 5
Output: 2
Explanation: 
Notice you can have extra video after the event ends.
```

Note: 1 &lt;= clips.length &lt;= 100 0 &lt;= clips\[i\]\[0\], clips\[i\]\[1\] &lt;= 100 0 &lt;= T &lt;= 100

## Analysis

Time: O\(N\) + O\(nlogn\)

## Thoughts

* Greedy solution \(better solution\):
  * find the furthest clip when start &lt; condition
  * can be more clear, introducing `findFurthestEnd(max_start, clips)` method 
* DP function: at clip i, it can at most covers. but it also requires sort first
* `DP(i) = max(DP(i-1), c[i][1] if c[i][0] <= DP(i-1) )`
  * `DP(i)` is valid, so only check if it can reach T

## Solution

```python
class Solution:
    def videoStitching(self, clips: List[List[int]], T: int) -> int:
        clips = sorted(clips, key = lambda x : (x[0]))
        
        pre_ending = 0
        result = 0
        far_curr = -1
        i = 0
        while i < len(clips):
            clip = clips[i]
            start = clip[0]
            end = clip[1]
            
            
            if start <= pre_ending:
                
                # only add 1 for this group 
                if far_curr == -1:
                    result += 1
                    
                far_curr = max(far_curr, end)
                
                # already done 
                if far_curr >= T:
                    break
                    
                i += 1
                    
            else:
                if far_curr == -1:
                    # unable to pick one
                    return -1
                
                # set the farthest before this selection 
                pre_ending = far_curr
                far_curr = -1
                
                # need to recheck this clip. back to loop
                    
                    
        # far_curr could be 
        # -1: not able to pick 
        # some val: able to pick 
        if far_curr < T:
            return -1
        else:
            return result
            # need to add the last one up 
            # last one doesn't have the next
                
        
```
