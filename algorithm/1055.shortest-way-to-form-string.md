# Shortest Way to Form String
[Shortest Way to Form String](https://leetcode.com/problems/shortest-way-to-form-string)

From any string, we can form a subsequence of that string by deleting some number of characters (possibly no deletions).

Given two strings source and target, return the minimum number of subsequences of source such that their concatenation equals target. If the task is impossible, return -1.

Example 2:
```
Input: source = "abc", target = "acdbc"
Output: -1
Explanation: The target string cannot be constructed from the subsequences of source string due to the character "d" in target string.
```
Example 3:
```
Input: source = "xyz", target = "xzyxz"
Output: 3
Explanation: The target string can be constructed as follows "xz" + "y" + "xz".
```

Constraints:
```
Both the source and target strings consist of only lowercase English letters from "a"-"z".
The lengths of source and target string are between 1 and 1000.
```
## Analysis
- brute force 2 pointers iterations
  - O(MN)
- How to do this in DP ?
  - the min number ending with (,i) , i not included 
  - `dp(i) = min(dp(i), dp(j) + 1)
- there's a better approach to use binary search 
    - putting source into map like `source_char_index = {'x' : [0, 3]}`
    - instead of comparing each i, j. we binary serch i (current source index) in `source_char_index[target_char]`
    
## Thoughts
- python: `bisect.bisect_left([], item)`

## Solution
```python
class Solution:
    def shortestWay(self, source: str, target: str) -> int:
        source_map = {}
        for s in source:
            source_map[s] = 1

        count = 1
        i = 0
        j = 0
        while j < len(target):
            if i >= len(source):
                # reset i
                count += 1
                i = 0


            s = source[i]
            t = target[j]
            if not t in source_map:
                return -1


            if s == t:
                i += 1
                j +=1
            else:
                i += 1

        return count
```
