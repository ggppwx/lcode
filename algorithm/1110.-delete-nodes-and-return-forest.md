# Delete Nodes And Return Forest

[Delete Nodes And Return Forest](https://leetcode.com/problems/delete-nodes-and-return-forest)

Given the root of a binary tree, each node in the tree has a distinct value.

After deleting all nodes with a value in to\_delete, we are left with a forest \(a disjoint union of trees\).

Return the roots of the trees in the remaining forest. You may return the result in any order.

Example 1:

```text
Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7], to_delete = [3,5]
Output: [[1,2,null,4],[6],[7]]
```

## Analysis

## Thoughts
- in place solution.
- For problems related to nodes(tree/graph/list) save parent in order to delete.


## Solution
```python
class Solution:
    def delNodes(self, root: TreeNode, to_delete: List[int]) -> List[TreeNode]:
        if not root:
            return []

        result = []
        def visit(node, parent, direction):
            if not node:
                return 

            if node.val in to_delete:          
                # need to delete this node
                if direction == 0: # parent to left
                    parent.left = None
                else:
                    parent.right = None

            else:
                if parent.val in to_delete:
                    result.append(node)


            visit(node.left, node, 0)
            visit(node.right, node, 1)


        if root.val not in to_delete:
            result.append(root)

        visit(root.left, root, 0)
        visit(root.right, root, 1)    

        return result
```
