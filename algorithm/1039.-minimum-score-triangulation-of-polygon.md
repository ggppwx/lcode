# minimum score triangulation of polygon

[Minimum Score Triangulation of Polygon](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-score-triangulation-of-polygon)

Given N, consider a convex N-sided polygon with vertices labelled A\[0\], A\[i\], ..., A\[N-1\] in clockwise order. Suppose you triangulate the polygon into N-2 triangles. For each triangle, the value of that triangle is the product of the labels of the vertices, and the total score of the triangulation is the sum of these values over all N-2 triangles in the triangulation.

Return the smallest possible total score that you can achieve with some triangulation of the polygon.

Example 1:

```text
Input: [1,2,3]
Output: 6
Explanation: The polygon is already triangulated, and the score of the only triangle is 6.
```

Example 2:

```text
Input: [3,7,4,5]
Output: 144
Explanation: There are two triangulations, with possible scores: 3*7*5 + 4*5*7 = 245, or 3*4*5 + 3*4*7 = 144.  The minimum score is 144.
```

## Analysis

* solution 1: time O\(n!\) this definitely looks aweful !
* In solution 2, we pick triangle instead of a point
  * `i -> j` is consecutive. just find k between `i` and `j`, it split the polygon to **2 consecutive** polygon
  * a triangle will split the polygon into 2 pieces 
  * for point 0 and N-1, it always constructs a triangle 
* Using bottom up solution ?
  * the filling order diagonally \(0,2\) -&gt; \(1, 3\) -&gt; \(2, 4\) -&gt; \(3, 5\)
  * nested loop, second loop `right = left + offset`


## Thoughts

* Convert the problem to sub-problem 
* DO NOT look this as a graph problem. 
  * keyword: min, and it is a list, thinking about sub-problem 
* DP solution has 2 ways: bottom-up vs top-down
  * How to traverse is the key of bottom-up 
  * drawing the matrix, solving by example 
* traversing matrix diagonally, means put the offset to the outer loop

## Solution
Solution 2: pick triangle, DP solution

```python
class Solution:
    def minScoreTriangulation(self, A: List[int]) -> int:
        # dp(i,j) = min(dp(i,k) + dp(k,j)) while k is between (i,j)
        # i, j is between [0, len(A)-1]
        if len(A) < 3:
            return 0 
            
            
        N = len(A)        
        dp = [[100000000 for _ in range(N)] for _ in range(N)]
        
        for offset in range(N):
            # the right way to iterate the matrix 
            # puting offset in the outer loop 
            for i in range(0,N-offset):
                j = i + offset
                
                if i == j:
                    dp[i][j] = 0
                elif abs(i-j) == 1:
                    dp[i][j] = 0
                else:
                    for k in range(i+1,j):
                        dp[i][j] = min(dp[i][j], dp[i][k] + dp[k][j] + A[i] * A[j] * A[k])
                        
        return dp[0][N-1]
```

Solution 1: exceeding time limit

```python
class Solution:
    def minScoreTriangulation(self, A: List[int]) -> int:
        cache = {}
        return minScoreTriangulation(A, cache)

    def minScoreTriangulation(self, A: List[int], cache) -> int:
        if len(A) < 3:
            return 0

        key = '#'.join(sorted(A))
        if key in cache:
            return cache[key]

        result = 2**31 - 1
        for i, a in enumerate(A):
            # pick a and its closest neighbor 
            A_right = A[(i+1)%len(A)]
            A_left = A[i - 1]
            triangle = a * A_left * A_right

            leftover = A[:i] + A[i+1:]
            result = min( result, triangle + self.minScoreTriangulation(leftover, cache) ) 

        cache[key] = result         
        return result
```
